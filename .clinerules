# FEH Barracks Manager - Project Rules

## Project Architecture
- This is a two-part scraping pipeline: 
  1. Scout (Maintenance_Updater.js): Scans the master list and updates the index.
  2. Researcher (build_parser.js): Performs deep scrapes on individual unit pages.
- NEVER consolidate these into one script. They must remain separate to manage IP rate limits and failures.

## Scraping Logic
- Container Focus: The Game8 Tier List uses a lazy-loading container. Always target 'div[class*="style-module__cardView"]' for scrolling and clicking.
- Scrolling: Use programmatic container scrolling (scrollTop) rather than window scrolling or keyboard PageDown.
- User Agent: Always mask as a standard Windows Chrome browser.
- Timeouts: Use a protocolTimeout of at least 180000ms for deep scraping.

## Data Schema
- index.json: Master list with [name, url, tier, weapon, move].
- units/[hero_name].json: Detailed info including:
    - raw_text_data: Sanitized text dump (no scripts/ads) for AI training.
    - recommended_build: Structured JSON object of skills.
    - ivs: Asset/Flaw recommendations.
